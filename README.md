# ambient: Cr√®me de la dotfiles

Wrapped in a hard Shell, these Perly white dotfiles
are begging to be bashed open and used. Don't delay, git them today!
Serving suggestion: Add a cup of lukewarm JavaScript warmed by a V8 engine.

Using the wonderful, terrible, and very bad symlink, everything is linked!

## Installation: Linux, WSL

Just [`sudo ./linux/install.pl`](linux/install.pl).
If it bricks your computer, that's your fault for not reading it.
I've got no idea if this works on MacOS and my setup doesn't involve MacOS.
Who knows, it might ruin your entire install! If it does, I'm not responsible!
I simply cannot be held accountable.

## Installation: Windows

LMAO good luck
